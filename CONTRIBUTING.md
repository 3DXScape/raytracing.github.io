Contributing To The Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series
====================================================================================================

The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series is intended to be lightweight and accessible for all who
want to learn about ray tracing and related graphics topics. To that end, we welcome feedback,
proposals, and improvements.

In particular, we have recently moved to a dedicated GitHub organization, and are working hard to
get set up in the new location. On top of this, we're converting the books (already freely available
to the public) to HTML, so that we can keep the content up-to-date with the latest corrections and
improvements.

If you're interested in helping out, there are a number of ways you could help us. The most pressing
right now is converting the books to [Markdeep][], a great Markdown-like format with lots of extra
goodies (like mathematical equations and diagrams).

Here are other ways you can help improve these books.


Project Homes
--------------
There are currently three projects — one for each book:

  - [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_][]
  - [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_][]
  - [_Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_][]


Issues
-------
The easiest way to help out is to log any issues you find in the books. Unclear passages, errors of
all kinds, even better ways to present something — just go to the appropriate project on GitHub and
locate the issues tab. This will take you to the current issues for that book. Here are the direct
links:

  - [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ - Issues](https://github.com/raytracing/raytracinginoneweekend/issues/)
  - [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_ - Issues](https://github.com/raytracing/raytracingthenextweek/issues/)
  - [_Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_ - Issues](https://github.com/raytracing/raytracingtherestofyourlife/issues/)


_Before creating a new issue_, please review existing issues to see if someone has already submitted
the same one. Odds are you're not the first to encounter something, so a little quick research can
save everyone some hassle.

When entering a new issue, please include all relevant information, particularly for issues with
source code.


Pull Requests
--------------
If you have a change that you think would be worthwhile, start with creating an issue, and include
the fact that you're willing to submit the change yourself (much appreciated!). We'll let you know
if it sounds like a good idea. If so, create your own fork of the project, make the changes, and
then create a standard GitHub pull request for us to review.

New to GitHub? We'll walk you through the process above. Just mention that you'd like a little
guidance in the proposal issue.
