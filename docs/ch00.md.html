In Ray Tracing In One Weekend

and Ray Tracing: the Next Week

, you built a “real” ray tracer.
In this volume, I assume you will be pursuing a career related to ray tracing and we will dive
into the math of creating a very serious ray tracer. When you are done you should be ready to
start messing with the many serious commercial ray tracers underlying the movie and product
design industries. There are many many things I do not cover in this short volume; I dive into
only one of many ways to write a Monte Carlo rendering program. I don’t do shadow rays
(instead I make rays more likely to go toward lights), bidirectional methods, Metropolis
methods, or photon mapping. What I do is speak in the language of the field that studies
those methods. I think of this book as a deep exposure that can be your first of many, and it
will equip you with some of the concepts, math, and terms you will need to study the others.
As before, www.in1weekend.com will have further readings and references.
