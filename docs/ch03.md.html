Chapter 3 Solid Textures
A  texture

in graphics usually means a function that makes the colors on a surface procedural.
This procedure can be synthesis code, or it could be an image lookup, or a combination of both.
We will first make  all colors

a texture. Most programs keep constant rgb colors and textures
different classes so feel free to do something different, but I am a big believer in this architecture
because being able to make any color a texture is great.
Now we can make textured materials by replacing the vec3 color with a texture pointer:
where you used to have
new lambertian(vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)))
now you should replace the vec3(...) with  new constant_texture(vec3(...))
new lambertian(new constant_texture(vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))))
We can create a checker texture by noting that the sign of sine and cosine just alternates in a
regular way and if we multiply trig functions in all three dimensions, the sign of that product
forms a 3D checker pattern.
Those checker odd/even pointers can be to a constant texture or to some other procedural
texture. This is in the spirit of shader networks introduced by Pat Hanrahan back in the 1980s.
If we add this to our random_scene() functionâ€™s base sphere:
We get:
If we add a new scene:
With camera:
We get:
