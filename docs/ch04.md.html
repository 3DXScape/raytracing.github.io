Chapter 4 Perlin Noise
To get cool looking solid textures most people use some form of  Perlin noise

. These are named
after their inventor Ken Perlin. Perlin texture doesn’t return white noise like this:
Instead it returns something similar to blurred white noise:
A key part of Perlin noise is that it is repeatable: it takes a 3D point as input and always returns
the same randomish number. Nearby points return similar numbers. Another important part of
Perlin noise is that it be simple and fast, so it’s usually done as a hack. I’ll build that hack up
incrementally based on Andrew Kensler’s description.
We could just tile all of space with a 3D array of random numbers and use them in blocks. You
get something blocky where the repeating is clear:
Let’s just use some sort of hashing to scramble this, instead of tiling. This has a bit of support
code to make it all happen:
Now if we create an actual texture that takes these floats between 0 and 1 and creates grey
colors:
And we can use that one some spheres:
With the same camera as before:
Add the hashing does scramble as hoped:
To make it smooth, we can linearly interpolate:
And we get:
Better, but there are obvious grid features in there. Some of it is  Mach bands,

a known
perceptual artifact of linear interpolation of color. A standard trick is to use a  hermite cubic

to
round off the interpolation:
This gives a smoother looking image:
It is also a bit low frequency. We can scale the input point to make it vary more quickly:
which gives:
This is still a bit grid blocky looking, probably because the min and max of the pattern always
lands exactly on the integer x/y/z. Ken Perlin’s very clever trick was to instead put random unit
vectors (instead of just floats) on the lattice points, and use a dot product to move the min and
max off the lattice. So, first we need to change the random floats to random vectors:
These vectors are any reasonable set of irregular directions, and I won't bother to make them
exactly uniform:
The Perlin class is now:
And the interpolation becomes a bit more complicated:
This finally gives something more reasonable looking:
Very often, a composite noise that has multiple summed frequencies is used. This is usually
called  turbulence

and is a sum of repeated calls to noise:
Here fabs() is the math.h absolute value function.
Used directly, turbulence gives a sort of camouflage netting appearance:
However, usually turbulence is used indirectly. For example, the “hello world” of procedural solid
textures is a simple marble-like texture. The basic idea is to make color proportional to
something like a sine function, and use turbulence to adjust the phase (so it shifts  x

in sin( x

))
which makes the stripes undulate. Commenting out straight noise and turbulence, and giving a
marble-like effect is:
Which yields:
