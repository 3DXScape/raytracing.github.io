Chapter 6 Rectangles and Lights
First, let’s make a light emitting material. We need to add an emitted function (we could also add
it to hit_record instead-- that’s a matter of design taste). Like the background, it just tells the ray
what color it is and performs no reflection. It’s very simple:
So that I don’t have to make all the non-emitting materials implement emitted(), I have the base
class return black:
Next, let’s make the background black in our color function, and pay attention to emitted.:
Now, let’s make some rectangles. Rectangles are often convenient for modelling man-made
environments. I’m a fan of doing axis-aligned rectangles because they are easy. (We’ll get to
instancing so we can rotate them later.)
First, here is a rectangle in an xy plane. Such a plane is defined by its  z

value. For example,  z =
k

. An axis-aligned rectangle is defined by lines  x=x0

,  x=x1

,  y=y0

,  y=y1

.
To determine whether a ray hits such a rectangle, we first determine where the ray hits the
plane. Recall that a ray  p

(t) =

a

+ t*

b

has its  z

component defined by  z(t) = az + t*bz

.
Rearranging those terms we can solve for what the  t

is where  z=k

.
t = (k-az) / bz
Once we have  t

, we can plug that into the equations for  x

and  y

:
x = ax + t*bx
y = ay + t*by
It is a hit if  x0 < x < x1

and  y0 < y < y1

.
The actual xy_rect class is thus:
And the hit function is:
If we set up a rectangle as a light:
We get:
Note that the light is brighter than (1,1,1). This allows it to be bright enough to light things.
Fool around with making some spheres lights too.
Now let’s add the other two axes and the famous Cornell Box.
This is yz and xz.
With unsurprising hit functions:
Let’s make the 5 walls and the light of the box:
And the view info:
We get:
This is very noisy because the light is small. But why are the other walls missing? They are
facing the wrong way. We need outward facing normals. Let’s make a hitable that does nothing
but hold another hitable, but reverses the normals:
This makes Cornell:
And voila:
